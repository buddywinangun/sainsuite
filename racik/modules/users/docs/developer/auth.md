# Users/Auth

Racik includes an Auth library in the Users module which handles user authentication and authorization.
User authentication allows the application to confirm the user's identity (in terms of confirming that they can access a particular user account on the site).
User authorization allows the application to determine what the user is allowed to do (verifying that a user has permission to visit a particular page or perform a particular action).
